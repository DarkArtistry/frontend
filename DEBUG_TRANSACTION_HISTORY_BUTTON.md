# Debug: Transaction History Button Not Showing

## Issue
The Transaction History button is not visible in the DeployPanel component.

## Root Cause
The button only shows when **both** conditions are met:
1. ✅ Web3 features are enabled (`config.features.blockchainInteraction.isEnabled`)
2. ❌ **Wallet is connected** (`isConnected` from wagmi)

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet
The Transaction History button only appears **after you connect your wallet**:

1. Go to the contract editor 
2. Look for the "Connect Wallet" button
3. Click it and connect MetaMask (or your preferred wallet)
4. **After connection**, you should see two buttons side by side:
   - "Disconnect" 
   - **"Transaction History"** ← This is what you're looking for!

### Step 2: Verify the Button Location
The button appears in this section of the Deploy Panel:

```
Deploy & Run
├── Connected: 0x1234...abcd
└── [Disconnect] [Transaction History] ← Here!
```

### Step 3: Test the SDK Notifications
Now all notifications will have distinctive markers:

- **🔗 SDK:** for pending transactions
- **✅ SDK:** for successful transactions  
- **❌ SDK:** for failed transactions
- **📋 SDK:** for transaction history popup

## Provider Hierarchy ✅

The ChakraProvider → BlockscoutSDKProvider hierarchy is correct:

```
ChakraProvider
  └── Web3ModalProvider
      └── BlockscoutSDKProvider ← SDK can use Chakra toaster
          └── App Components
```

This allows the SDK mock to use Chakra's toaster system properly.

## Quick Test

1. **Connect wallet** in the contract editor
2. **Click "Transaction History"** → Should show: `📋 SDK: Transaction History`
3. **Try to deploy without selecting a contract** → Should show: `❌ SDK: Deployment Error`
4. **Deploy a contract** → Should show: `🔗 SDK: Contract Deployment Submitted`

## If Button Still Doesn't Show

Check Web3 configuration:
```typescript
// Should be enabled due to forceEnable = true
config.features.blockchainInteraction.isEnabled
```

If needed, we can add a debug component to show the current state.
