# ✅ Real Transaction History Implementation Complete!

## What's Now Working

The **Transaction History** button now shows **REAL** transaction data from your Blockscout API instead of mock data!

### 🔥 Real Features Implemented:

1. **Live Transaction Fetching** - Uses the same API that powers the main Blockscout interface
2. **Real Transaction Details** - Shows actual transactions from your wallet
3. **Smart Categorization** - Automatically detects Send vs Receive vs Contract calls
4. **Status Indicators** - Real success/failure status with visual indicators
5. **Value Display** - Shows actual PLASMA amounts transferred
6. **Explorer Links** - Direct links to view full transaction details
7. **Loading States** - Shows loading spinner while fetching
8. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of API errors or no transactions

### 📊 What You'll See:

**When Connected & Have Transactions:**
```
📋 SDK: Transaction History
🔗 Recent Transactions

📤 Send
To: 0x1234...abcd • Status: ✅ Success • Block: 12345

🔍 View Details

📥 Receive

```

**When Not Connected:**
```

```

**When Loading:**
```

```

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation:

- **API**: Uses `'general:address_txs'` endpoint
- **Data Source**: Real Blockscout API (same as main transaction lists)
- **Real-time**: Fetches fresh data each time button is clicked
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper transaction types
- **Performance**: Efficient API calls with proper caching

### 🎯 User Experience:

1. **Connect your wallet** in the contract editor
2. **Click "Transaction History"** → See your real transaction data
3. **View transaction details** by clicking "View Details" links
4. **Access full history** via "View All Transactions on Blockscout"

### 🔗 Explorer Integration:

All links point to: `https://ethglobal-blockscout.roax.network`
- Individual transaction details
- Full address transaction history
- Complete blockchain explorer access

## Perfect Integration ✨

This implementation:
- ✅ **Uses real data** from your Blockscout API
- ✅ **Matches the SDK API** for easy migration to real SDK later
- ✅ **Provides rich transaction details** with proper formatting
- ✅ **Handles all edge cases** (loading, errors, empty state)
- ✅ **Maintains consistency** with existing Blockscout UI patterns

You now have a **production-ready transaction history feature** that shows real data from your blockchain! 🚀
