# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Fix Blockscout SDK for ETHGlobal Competition

## The Issue
The current implementation uses a MOCK SDK instead of the real `@blockscout/app-sdk`. This is NOT acceptable for the competition!

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Install the Real SDK
```bash
cd blockscout-frontend
npm install @blockscout/app-sdk --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Update `lib/blockscout-sdk/providers.tsx`
Replace:
```javascript
import { NotificationProvider, TransactionPopupProvider } from './mock-sdk';
```

With:
```javascript
import { NotificationProvider, TransactionPopupProvider } from '@blockscout/app-sdk';
```

### 3. Update `ui/contractEditor/DeployPanel.tsx`  
Replace:
```javascript
import { useNotification, useTransactionPopup } from 'lib/blockscout-sdk/mock-sdk';
```

With:
```javascript
import { useNotification, useTransactionPopup } from '@blockscout/app-sdk';
```

### 4. Fix the Notification Call
The real SDK uses a different API. In `DeployPanel.tsx`, change:
```javascript
// Current mock implementation
showNotification(hash, {
  chainId: 135,
  pending: { title: '...', description: '...' },
  success: { title: '...', description: '...' },
  error: { title: '...', description: '...' }
});
```

To:
```javascript
// Real SDK implementation
const { openTxToast } = useNotification();
openTxToast("135", hash); // Chain ID as string, transaction hash
```

## Why This Matters
- The real SDK provides ACTUAL blockchain monitoring
- Real-time transaction status updates from the blockchain
- Proper integration with Blockscout explorer
- Shows you're using partner technology correctly

## Verification
After fixing, when you deploy a contract:
1. You should see a real transaction toast notification
2. It should update from "pending" to "success" automatically
3. Clicking the notification should open the transaction in Blockscout

## For Your ETHGlobal Submission
Make sure to mention:
- "We integrated the official Blockscout SDK for real-time transaction notifications"
- "Contract deployments are monitored in real-time using Blockscout's WebSocket connections"
- "Users get instant feedback when their contracts are deployed and verified"

## Emergency Fallback
If you can't get the real SDK working due to dependency issues:
1. At least document that you TRIED to use the real SDK
2. Show the integration code that WOULD work with the real SDK
3. Explain the dependency conflict that prevented installation

But ideally, GET THE REAL SDK WORKING!
