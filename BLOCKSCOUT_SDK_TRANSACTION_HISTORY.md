# Blockscout SDK Transaction History - Implementation Details

## Current State

The Transaction History button now works and shows a **mock transaction history** popup with:

- ‚úÖ Sample recent transactions (Contract Deployment, Token Transfer)
- ‚úÖ Direct links to view transactions on Blockscout
- ‚úÖ Link to view all transactions for your address
- ‚úÖ Correct explorer URL: `https://ethglobal-blockscout.roax.network`

## Understanding the Implementation

### 1. **Mock vs Real SDK**
What you're seeing is a **mock implementation** that simulates what the real Blockscout SDK would do:

**Current Mock Behavior:**
- Shows sample transactions in a notification toast
- Provides links to the Blockscout explorer
- Displays for 20 seconds

**Real SDK Behavior (when installed):**
- Opens an actual popup modal/window
- Fetches real transaction history from your wallet
- Shows live transaction status updates
- Provides filtering and search capabilities

### 2. **Explorer URL Updated**
All links now point to: `https://ethglobal-blockscout.roax.network`
- Transaction links
- Address links  
- Explorer references

## How to View Real Transaction History

### Option 1: Direct Blockscout Link
The mock provides a direct link to view your actual transactions:

1. Click "Transaction History" button
2. In the popup, click **"üîç View All Transactions on Blockscout"**
3. This opens your address page on the actual Blockscout explorer

### Option 2: Manual Navigation
1. Go to: `https://ethglobal-blockscout.roax.network`
2. Search for your wallet address
3. View all your real transactions

## Why Use a Mock?

The mock SDK allows us to:
- ‚úÖ Test integration immediately without package conflicts
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate the SDK API usage  
- ‚úÖ Validate the user experience flow
- ‚úÖ Show what the real SDK would provide

## Next Steps for Full Transaction History

### 1. Install Real SDK (when npm issues are resolved)
```bash
npm install @blockscout/app-sdk
```

### 2. Replace Mock Import
```typescript
// Change this:
import { useTransactionPopup } from 'lib/blockscout-sdk/mock-sdk';

// To this:
import { useTransactionPopup } from '@blockscout/app-sdk';
```

### 3. Real SDK Features You'll Get
- **Live Transaction Fetching**: Real-time updates from blockchain
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by type, status, date
- **Transaction Details**: Gas used, method calls, logs
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Switch between different networks
- **Export Capabilities**: Download transaction history

## Current Implementation Benefits

Even with the mock, you get:
- ‚úÖ Consistent SDK API usage pattern
- ‚úÖ Proper integration architecture
- ‚úÖ Explorer URL configuration
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback for all actions
- ‚úÖ Easy migration path to real SDK

## Testing the Integration

1. **View Mock History**: Click "Transaction History" ‚Üí See sample transactions
2. **Test Explorer Links**: Click any transaction link ‚Üí Opens in Blockscout
3. **Check Notifications**: All show "SDK:" prefix for easy identification
4. **Verify URL**: All links go to `https://ethglobal-blockscout.roax.network`

The implementation is ready for the real SDK - just swap the import when package installation works!
